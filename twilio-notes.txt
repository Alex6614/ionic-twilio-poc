Demo:

	1) Grab an access token from: https://www.twilio.com/console/video/runtime/testing-tools

		- Give any name

	2) In controller.js around Line 52, replace the token with the above token

	3) Run "ionic cordova run android" with the android phone connected

	4) Grab a different access token with A DIFFERENT NAME from the above link

	5) In controller.js, replace the old token with the new one

	6) Run "ionic cordova run browser"

	7) Both should connect


Problems encountered:

	1) Adding a 3rd party library: I used "bower install..." to install "twilio-video". This installed the files to /lib, and I was able to run a <script> in index.html to load that file. To access the library, use "Twilio.Video..."

	2) Not sure if this was a problem but I whitelisted everything using the whitelist plugin

	3) To fix the getUserMedia bug on Android, I added a few lines in app.js and requested permission to use the camera, audio etc. But this wasn't fully fixed until I went into the AndroidManifest.xml and added multiple <uses-permission ...> lines.

	4) If one person goes into another room, and another goes into the room, the first person's video drops: Make sure that both people have different access tokens with different names (need to check if the name needs to be different, but tokens were definitely different)
